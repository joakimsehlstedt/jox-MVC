Hi, I'm Joakim and at the moment I'm studying PHP programming at Blekinge 
Institute of Technology in Sweden. 

Originally I come from Värnamo in Småland, Sweden, a place I at the age of nine abandoned for a more 
vibrant and exciting life in Jönköping, Sweden. At the moment I live in 
England, just outside Oxford, in a small English village. The surroundings here 
are quite similar to that of where "Emmerdale" is set, if you ever came across 
the television program :)

What I like most to spend my time on is to play and record music, and on the 
side of my ambitions as a programmer, I want to devote as much time I absolutely 
can to do this.

My past experience of programming is rather limited. I have completed 
introductory courses in C#, C and Java, and I've done some with HTML and CSS before. 
I really enjoy the topic and look forward to get really good at PHP and 
generally improve my knowledge and skills in this art form, regardless of the 
programming language .
